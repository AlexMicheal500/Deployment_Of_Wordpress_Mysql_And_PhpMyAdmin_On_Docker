TROUBLESHOOTING: Why does this happen: Connection closed by [my host IP] port 22
PROPOSED SOLUTION: 
I'm really not sure what happened here. I never could get rsa to work so I thought I'd try ecdsa. I generated a key pair and copied the public ecdsa key to the authorized_keys file on the host. I tried to ssh with that and it worked:

pi@raspsky:~/.ssh $ ssh -i /home/pi/.ssh/id_ecdsa mgnewman@[myhost].com
Last login: Sun Aug 23 23:53:26 2020 from 1.20.171.54
mgnewman@[myhost].com [~]# exit

Then I tried rsa again. It also worked.

SOLUTION 2: Reconfigure openssh-server
		$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

OUTOUT: Requesting a certificate for alexmichealserver.ddns.net and www.alexmichealserver.ddns.net

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: apache). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: www.alexmichealserver.ddns.net
  Type:   dns
  Detail: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for www.alexmichealserver.ddns.net - check that a DNS record exists for this domain; DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up AAAA for www.alexmichealserver.ddns.net - check that a DNS record exists for this domain

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary Apache configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure that the listed domains point to this Apache server and that it is accessible from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v 

SOLUTION: Input domain_name.com alone, it will work.
