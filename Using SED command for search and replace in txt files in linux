There are two ways
The first is:
$ nano test.txt 
(Write anything inside and then do search and replace using)
$ sed -i 's/file/cars/g' test.txt

OR
Using commas especially when operations involve url, it could give errors. So its better to use commas instead of /
$ sed -i 's,file,cars,g' test.txt

IF WE ARE DEALING WITH VARIABLES:
export change=$(cat old_url.txt)
export change2=$(cat dev_url.txt)
$ sed -i "s,$change,$change2,g" "test.txt"
